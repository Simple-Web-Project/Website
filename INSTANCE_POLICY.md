# Instance Policy

Things that are not permitted:
1. Cloudflare (Only the proxying part)
2. Trackers
3. Additional JS (Reason: This instance list is intended for people who want a stock experience and so they can kind of expect what they get themselves into when they load an instance on that list)

Also, if you change ANYTHING on the instance that you host that varies from the stock code that we provide on our repository, you are mandated to publish the source code for that on some source forge, please also add a link to the instance page itself, if you make such changes.
