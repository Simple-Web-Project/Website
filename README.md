## How to add your own Instance
First, you can check if your instance complies with our Instance Policy (You can see it in the INSTANCE_POLICY.md file in this repository)

You gotta find the list of instances inside of `config.json`, add the instance there. Or alternatively contact us and ask us to add it ourselves (Email, Matrix, IRC).

If you want to stay updated on Instance Policy changes and also changes about wether your instance may have been removed from the list for whatever reason it may be: Consider subscribing to our SimpleWebInstancers Mailing list: https://lists.sr.ht/~metalune/SimpleWebInstancers
